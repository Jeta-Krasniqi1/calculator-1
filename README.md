# calculator-1

## Overview
This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Supports four basic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Uses a `switch` statement to process user input
- Takes user input via the console using `Scanner`
- Displays the computed result

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Java-supported environment.
2. Select an operation by entering a number:
   - `1` for Addition
   - `2` for Subtraction
   - `3` for Multiplication
   - `4` for Division
3. Enter the first number.
4. Enter the second number.
5. The program computes and displays the result.

## Example Usage
```
1 - Add
2 - Subtract
3 - Multiply
4 - Divide
Choose Operator: 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
The result is: 8
```

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Any Java IDE or terminal to compile and run the program

## Potential Improvements
- Add exception handling for division by zero
- Implement floating-point operations
- Provide a GUI version using Java Swing or JavaFX
